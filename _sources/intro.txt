Introduction
============

PyPM provides a :py:class:`pypm.particlemesh.ParticleMesh` object for solving forces with the particle mesh
method.

ParticleMesh object is a state machine. 

The typical routine for calculating force is

1. Paint particles via :py:meth:`paint`
2. Real to Complex transform via :py:meth:`r2c`
3. Complex to Real transform via :py:meth:`c2r`, applying transfer functions
4. Read out force values     via :py:meth:`readout`
5. go back to 3, for other force components

We provide a set of commonly used transfer functions in :py:class:`pypm.transfer.TransferFunction`.
